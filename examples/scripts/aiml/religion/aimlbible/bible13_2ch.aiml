<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 1 1</pattern><template>And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 1 2</pattern><template>Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 1 3</pattern><template>So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 1 4</pattern><template>But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 1 5</pattern><template>Moreover the brazen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 1 6</pattern><template>And Solomon went up thither to the brazen altar before the LORD, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 1 7</pattern><template>In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 1 8</pattern><template>And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast showed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 1 9</pattern><template>Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 1 10</pattern><template>Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 1 11</pattern><template>And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 1 12</pattern><template>Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 1 13</pattern><template>Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 1 14</pattern><template>And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 1 15</pattern><template>And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycamore trees that are in the vale for abundance.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 1 16</pattern><template>And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 1 17</pattern><template>And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 2 1</pattern><template>And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 2 2</pattern><template>And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 2 3</pattern><template>And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 2 4</pattern><template>Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This is an ordinance for ever to Israel.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 2 5</pattern><template>And the house which I build is great: for great is our God above all gods.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 2 6</pattern><template>But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 2 7</pattern><template>Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 2 8</pattern><template>Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants,</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 2 9</pattern><template>Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build shall be wonderful great.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 2 10</pattern><template>And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 2 11</pattern><template>Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath made thee king over them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 2 12</pattern><template>Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 2 13</pattern><template>And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's,</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 2 14</pattern><template>The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 2 15</pattern><template>Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 2 16</pattern><template>And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 2 17</pattern><template>And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 2 18</pattern><template>And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 3 1</pattern><template>Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 3 2</pattern><template>And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 3 3</pattern><template>Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 3 4</pattern><template>And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 3 5</pattern><template>And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 3 6</pattern><template>And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 3 7</pattern><template>He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubim on the walls.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 3 8</pattern><template>And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 3 9</pattern><template>And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 3 10</pattern><template>And in the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work, and overlaid them with gold.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 3 11</pattern><template>And the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: one wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 3 12</pattern><template>And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 3 13</pattern><template>The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were inward.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 3 14</pattern><template>And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubim thereon.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 3 15</pattern><template>Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 3 16</pattern><template>And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 3 17</pattern><template>And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 4 1</pattern><template>Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 4 2</pattern><template>Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 4 3</pattern><template>And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 4 4</pattern><template>It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 4 5</pattern><template>And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; and it received and held three thousand baths.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 4 6</pattern><template>He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 4 7</pattern><template>And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.</template></category>

<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 4 11</pattern><template>And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God;</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 4 12</pattern><template>To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the top of the pillars;</template></category>

<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 5 1</pattern><template>Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house of God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 5 2</pattern><template>Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 5 3</pattern><template>Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 5 4</pattern><template>And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 5 5</pattern><template>And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, these did the priests and the Levites bring up.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 5 6</pattern><template>Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 5 7</pattern><template>And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim:</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 5 8</pattern><template>For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves thereof above.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 5 9</pattern><template>And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without. And there it is unto this day.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 5 10</pattern><template>There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 5 11</pattern><template>And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did not then wait by course:</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 5 12</pattern><template>Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 5 13</pattern><template>It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the LORD;</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 5 14</pattern><template>So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 1</pattern><template>Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 2</pattern><template>But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place for thy dwelling for ever.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 3</pattern><template>And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 4</pattern><template>And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath with his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father David, saying,</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 5</pattern><template>Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel:</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 6</pattern><template>But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 7</pattern><template>Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 8</pattern><template>But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in thine heart:</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 9</pattern><template>Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 10</pattern><template>The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken: for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 11</pattern><template>And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, that he made with the children of Israel.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 12</pattern><template>And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands:</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 13</pattern><template>For Solomon had made a brazen scaffold of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 14</pattern><template>And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee in the heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and showest mercy unto thy servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts:</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 15</pattern><template>Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 16</pattern><template>Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel; yet so that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 17</pattern><template>Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 18</pattern><template>But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built!</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 19</pattern><template>Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee:</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 20</pattern><template>That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 21</pattern><template>Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear thou from thy dwelling place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 22</pattern><template>If a man sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house;</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 23</pattern><template>Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 24</pattern><template>And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 25</pattern><template>Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 26</pattern><template>When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; yet if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them;</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 27</pattern><template>Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 28</pattern><template>If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillars; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be:</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 29</pattern><template>Then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any man, or of all thy people Israel, when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house:</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 30</pattern><template>Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men:)</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 6 31</pattern><template>That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.</template></category>

<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 11 13</pattern><template>And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 11 14</pattern><template>For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the LORD:</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 11 15</pattern><template>And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 11 16</pattern><template>And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 11 17</pattern><template>So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 11 18</pattern><template>And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;</template></category>

<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 11 21</pattern><template>And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and threescore daughters.)</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 11 22</pattern><template>And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be ruler among his brethren: for he thought to make him king.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 11 23</pattern><template>And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he desired many wives.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 12 1</pattern><template>And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 12 2</pattern><template>And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 12 3</pattern><template>With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 12 4</pattern><template>And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 12 5</pattern><template>Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 12 6</pattern><template>Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 12 7</pattern><template>And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 12 8</pattern><template>Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 12 9</pattern><template>So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 12 10</pattern><template>Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king's house.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 12 11</pattern><template>And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 12 12</pattern><template>And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah things went well.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 12 13</pattern><template>So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.</template></category>
<category><pattern>2 Chronicles 12 14</pattern><template>And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.</template></category>
