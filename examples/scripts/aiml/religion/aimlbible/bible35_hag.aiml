<category><pattern>Haggai 1 12</pattern><template>Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the LORD.</template></category>

<category><pattern>Haggai 2 5</pattern><template>According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Haggai 2 6</pattern><template>For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;</template></category>

<category><pattern>Haggai 2 16</pattern><template>Since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty measures, there were but ten: when one came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty.</template></category>
