<category><pattern>Zephaniah 2 8</pattern><template>I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Zephaniah 2 9</pattern><template>Therefore as I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, even the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall spoil them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Zephaniah 2 10</pattern><template>This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the LORD of hosts.</template></category>

<category><pattern>Zephaniah 2 15</pattern><template>This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.</template></category>

<category><pattern>Zephaniah 3 5</pattern><template>The just LORD is in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Zephaniah 3 6</pattern><template>I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Zephaniah 3 7</pattern><template>I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but they rose early, and corrupted all their doings.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Zephaniah 3 8</pattern><template>Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Zephaniah 3 9</pattern><template>For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Zephaniah 3 10</pattern><template>From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Zephaniah 3 11</pattern><template>In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Zephaniah 3 12</pattern><template>I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Zephaniah 3 13</pattern><template>The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Zephaniah 3 14</pattern><template>Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Zephaniah 3 15</pattern><template>The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Zephaniah 3 16</pattern><template>In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Zephaniah 3 17</pattern><template>The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing.</template></category>

<category><pattern>Zephaniah 3 20</pattern><template>At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD.</template></category>
