<category><pattern>Ezra 1 1</pattern><template>Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,</template></category>

<category><pattern>Ezra 3 5</pattern><template>And afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 3 6</pattern><template>From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 3 7</pattern><template>They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 3 8</pattern><template>Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 3 9</pattern><template>Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 3 10</pattern><template>And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 3 11</pattern><template>And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 3 12</pattern><template>But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 3 13</pattern><template>So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 4 1</pattern><template>Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of Israel;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 4 2</pattern><template>Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 4 3</pattern><template>But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 4 4</pattern><template>Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 4 5</pattern><template>And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 4 6</pattern><template>And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 4 7</pattern><template>And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 4 8</pattern><template>Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 4 9</pattern><template>Then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 4 10</pattern><template>And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side the river, and at such a time.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 4 11</pattern><template>This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the river, and at such a time.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 4 12</pattern><template>Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 4 13</pattern><template>Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 4 14</pattern><template>Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 4 15</pattern><template>That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 4 16</pattern><template>We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 4 17</pattern><template>Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 4 18</pattern><template>The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 4 19</pattern><template>And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 4 20</pattern><template>There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 4 21</pattern><template>Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be given from me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 4 22</pattern><template>Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 4 23</pattern><template>Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 4 24</pattern><template>Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 5 1</pattern><template>Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even unto them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 5 2</pattern><template>Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 5 3</pattern><template>At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 5 4</pattern><template>Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 5 5</pattern><template>But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 5 6</pattern><template>The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai and his companions the Apharsachites, which were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 5 7</pattern><template>They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Darius the king, all peace.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 5 8</pattern><template>Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 5 9</pattern><template>Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 5 10</pattern><template>We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 5 11</pattern><template>And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 5 12</pattern><template>But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 5 13</pattern><template>But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 5 14</pattern><template>And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 5 15</pattern><template>And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in his place.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 5 16</pattern><template>Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not finished.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 5 17</pattern><template>Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 6 1</pattern><template>Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 6 2</pattern><template>And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus written:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 6 3</pattern><template>In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 6 4</pattern><template>With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king's house:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 6 5</pattern><template>And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to his place, and place them in the house of God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 6 6</pattern><template>Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be ye far from thence:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 6 7</pattern><template>Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 6 8</pattern><template>Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 6 9</pattern><template>And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 6 10</pattern><template>That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 6 11</pattern><template>Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 6 12</pattern><template>And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 6 13</pattern><template>Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shetharboznai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did speedily.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 6 14</pattern><template>And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo.

<category><pattern>Ezra 8 22</pattern><template>For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 8 23</pattern><template>So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 8 24</pattern><template>Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 8 25</pattern><template>And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered:</template></category>

<category><pattern>Ezra 8 30</pattern><template>So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 8 31</pattern><template>Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 8 32</pattern><template>And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 8 33</pattern><template>Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;</template></category>

<category><pattern>Ezra 9 3</pattern><template>And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 9 4</pattern><template>Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice.</template></category>

<category><pattern>Ezra 9 6</pattern><template>And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 9 7</pattern><template>Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is this day.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 9 8</pattern><template>And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 9 9</pattern><template>For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 9 10</pattern><template>And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 9 11</pattern><template>Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 9 12</pattern><template>Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 9 13</pattern><template>And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 9 14</pattern><template>Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 9 15</pattern><template>O LORD God of Israel, thou art righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee because of this.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 10 1</pattern><template>Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 10 2</pattern><template>And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 10 3</pattern><template>Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 10 4</pattern><template>Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be with thee: be of good courage, and do it.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 10 5</pattern><template>Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they sware.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 10 6</pattern><template>Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 10 7</pattern><template>And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 10 8</pattern><template>And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 10 9</pattern><template>Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days.

<category><pattern>Ezra 10 10</pattern><template>And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 10 11</pattern><template>Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the strange wives.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 10 12</pattern><template>Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 10 13</pattern><template>But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 10 14</pattern><template>Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 10 15</pattern><template>Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Ezra 10 16</pattern><template>And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.</template></category>
