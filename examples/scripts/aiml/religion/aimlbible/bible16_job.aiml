<category><pattern>Job 1 1</pattern><template>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 1 2</pattern><template>And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 1 3</pattern><template>His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 1 4</pattern><template>And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 1 5</pattern><template>And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 1 6</pattern><template>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 1 7</pattern><template>And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 1 8</pattern><template>And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 1 9</pattern><template>Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 1 10</pattern><template>Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 1 11</pattern><template>But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 1 12</pattern><template>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 1 13</pattern><template>And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 1 14</pattern><template>And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 1 15</pattern><template>And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 1 16</pattern><template>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 1 17</pattern><template>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 1 18</pattern><template>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 1 19</pattern><template>And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 1 20</pattern><template>Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 1 21</pattern><template>And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 1 22</pattern><template>In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 2 1</pattern><template>Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 2 2</pattern><template>And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 2 3</pattern><template>And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 2 4</pattern><template>And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 2 5</pattern><template>But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 2 6</pattern><template>And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 2 7</pattern><template>So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 2 8</pattern><template>And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 2 9</pattern><template>Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 2 10</pattern><template>But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 2 11</pattern><template>Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 2 12</pattern><template>And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 2 13</pattern><template>So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 3 1</pattern><template>After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 3 2</pattern><template>And Job spake, and said,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 3 3</pattern><template>Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 3 4</pattern><template>Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.|</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 3 5</pattern><template>Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 3 6</pattern><template>As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 3 7</pattern><template>Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 3 8</pattern><template>Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 3 9</pattern><template>Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 3 10</pattern><template>Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 3 11</pattern><template>Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 3 12</pattern><template>Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 3 13</pattern><template>For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 3 14</pattern><template>With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate places for themselves;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 3 15</pattern><template>Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 3 16</pattern><template>Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 3 17</pattern><template>There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 3 18</pattern><template>There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 3 19</pattern><template>The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 3 20</pattern><template>Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 3 21</pattern><template>Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 3 22</pattern><template>Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 3 23</pattern><template>Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 3 24</pattern><template>For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 3 25</pattern><template>For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 3 26</pattern><template>I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 4 1</pattern><template>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 4 2</pattern><template>If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 4 3</pattern><template>Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 4 4</pattern><template>Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 4 5</pattern><template>But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 4 6</pattern><template>Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 4 7</pattern><template>Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 4 8</pattern><template>Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 4 9</pattern><template>By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 4 10</pattern><template>The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 4 11</pattern><template>The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 4 12</pattern><template>Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 4 13</pattern><template>In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 4 14</pattern><template>Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 4 15</pattern><template>Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 4 16</pattern><template>It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 4 17</pattern><template>Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 4 18</pattern><template>Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 4 19</pattern><template>How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 4 20</pattern><template>They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 4 21</pattern><template>Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 5 1</pattern><template>Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 5 2</pattern><template>For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 5 3</pattern><template>I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 5 4</pattern><template>His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 5 5</pattern><template>Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 5 6</pattern><template>Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 5 7</pattern><template>Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 5 8</pattern><template>I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 5 9</pattern><template>Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 5 10</pattern><template>Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 5 11</pattern><template>To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 5 12</pattern><template>He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 5 13</pattern><template>He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 5 14</pattern><template>They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noonday as in the night.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 5 15</pattern><template>But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 5 16</pattern><template>So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 5 17</pattern><template>Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 5 18</pattern><template>For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 5 19</pattern><template>He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 5 20</pattern><template>In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 5 21</pattern><template>Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 5 22</pattern><template>At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 5 23</pattern><template>For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 5 24</pattern><template>And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 5 25</pattern><template>Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 5 26</pattern><template>Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 5 27</pattern><template>Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 1</pattern><template>But Job answered and said,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 2</pattern><template>Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 3</pattern><template>For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 4</pattern><template>For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 5</pattern><template>Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 6</pattern><template>Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 7</pattern><template>The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 8</pattern><template>Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 9</pattern><template>Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 10</pattern><template>Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 11</pattern><template>What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 12</pattern><template>Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 13</pattern><template>Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 14</pattern><template>To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 15</pattern><template>My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 16</pattern><template>Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 17</pattern><template>What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 18</pattern><template>The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 19</pattern><template>The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 20</pattern><template>They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 21</pattern><template>For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 22</pattern><template>Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 23</pattern><template>Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 24</pattern><template>Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 25</pattern><template>How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 26</pattern><template>Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 27</pattern><template>Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 28</pattern><template>Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 29</pattern><template>Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 6 30</pattern><template>Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 7 1</pattern><template>Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 7 2</pattern><template>As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 7 3</pattern><template>So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 7 4</pattern><template>When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 7 5</pattern><template>My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 7 6</pattern><template>My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 7 7</pattern><template>O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 7 8</pattern><template>The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 7 9</pattern><template>As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 7 10</pattern><template>He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 7 11</pattern><template>Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 7 12</pattern><template>Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 7 13</pattern><template>When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaints;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 7 14</pattern><template>Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 7 15</pattern><template>So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 7 16</pattern><template>I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 7 17</pattern><template>What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 7 18</pattern><template>And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 7 19</pattern><template>How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 7 20</pattern><template>I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 7 21</pattern><template>And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 8 1</pattern><template>Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 8 2</pattern><template>How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 8 3</pattern><template>Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 8 4</pattern><template>If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 8 5</pattern><template>If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 8 6</pattern><template>If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 8 7</pattern><template>Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 8 8</pattern><template>For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 8 9</pattern><template>(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 8 10</pattern><template>Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 8 11</pattern><template>Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 8 12</pattern><template>Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 8 13</pattern><template>So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 8 14</pattern><template>Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 8 15</pattern><template>He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 8 16</pattern><template>He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 8 17</pattern><template>His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 8 18</pattern><template>If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 8 19</pattern><template>Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 8 20</pattern><template>Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 8 21</pattern><template>Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 8 22</pattern><template>They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 1</pattern><template>Then Job answered and said,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 2</pattern><template>I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 3</pattern><template>If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 4</pattern><template>He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 5</pattern><template>Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 6</pattern><template>Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 7</pattern><template>Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 8</pattern><template>Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 9</pattern><template>Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 10</pattern><template>Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 11</pattern><template>Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 12</pattern><template>Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 13</pattern><template>If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 14</pattern><template>How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 15</pattern><template>Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 16</pattern><template>If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 17</pattern><template>For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 18</pattern><template>He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 19</pattern><template>If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 20</pattern><template>If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 21</pattern><template>Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 22</pattern><template>This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 23</pattern><template>If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 24</pattern><template>The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 25</pattern><template>Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 26</pattern><template>They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 27</pattern><template>If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 28</pattern><template>I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 29</pattern><template>If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 30</pattern><template>If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 31</pattern><template>Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 32</pattern><template>For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 33</pattern><template>Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 34</pattern><template>Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 9 35</pattern><template>Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 10 1</pattern><template>My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 10 2</pattern><template>I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 10 3</pattern><template>Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 10 4</pattern><template>Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 10 5</pattern><template>Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 10 6</pattern><template>That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 10 7</pattern><template>Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 10 8</pattern><template>Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 10 9</pattern><template>Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 10 10</pattern><template>Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 10 11</pattern><template>Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 10 12</pattern><template>Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 10 13</pattern><template>And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this is with thee.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 10 14</pattern><template>If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 10 15</pattern><template>If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 10 16</pattern><template>For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 10 17</pattern><template>Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 10 18</pattern><template>Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 10 19</pattern><template>I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 10 20</pattern><template>Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 10 21</pattern><template>Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 10 22</pattern><template>A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 11 1</pattern><template>Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 11 2</pattern><template>Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 11 3</pattern><template>Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 11 4</pattern><template>For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 11 5</pattern><template>But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 11 6</pattern><template>And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 11 7</pattern><template>Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 11 8</pattern><template>It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 11 9</pattern><template>The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 11 10</pattern><template>If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 11 11</pattern><template>For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 11 12</pattern><template>For vain men would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 11 13</pattern><template>If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 11 14</pattern><template>If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 11 15</pattern><template>For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 11 16</pattern><template>Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 11 17</pattern><template>And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday: thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 11 18</pattern><template>And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 11 19</pattern><template>Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 11 20</pattern><template>But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 12 1</pattern><template>And Job answered and said,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 12 2</pattern><template>No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 12 3</pattern><template>But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 12 4</pattern><template>I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 12 5</pattern><template>He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 12 6</pattern><template>The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 12 7</pattern><template>But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 12 8</pattern><template>Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 12 9</pattern><template>Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 12 10</pattern><template>In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 12 11</pattern><template>Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 12 12</pattern><template>With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 12 13</pattern><template>With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 12 14</pattern><template>Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 12 15</pattern><template>Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 12 16</pattern><template>With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 12 17</pattern><template>He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 12 18</pattern><template>He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 12 19</pattern><template>He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 12 20</pattern><template>He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 12 21</pattern><template>He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 12 22</pattern><template>He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 12 23</pattern><template>He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 12 24</pattern><template>He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 12 25</pattern><template>They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 1</pattern><template>Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 2</pattern><template>What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 3</pattern><template>Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 4</pattern><template>But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 5</pattern><template>O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 6</pattern><template>Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 7</pattern><template>Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 8</pattern><template>Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 9</pattern><template>Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 10</pattern><template>He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 11</pattern><template>Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 12</pattern><template>Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 13</pattern><template>Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 14</pattern><template>Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 15</pattern><template>Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 16</pattern><template>He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 17</pattern><template>Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 18</pattern><template>Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 19</pattern><template>Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 20</pattern><template>Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 21</pattern><template>Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 22</pattern><template>Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 23</pattern><template>How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 24</pattern><template>Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 25</pattern><template>Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 26</pattern><template>For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 27</pattern><template>Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 13 28</pattern><template>And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 14 1</pattern><template>Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 14 2</pattern><template>He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 14 3</pattern><template>And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 14 4</pattern><template>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 14 5</pattern><template>Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 14 6</pattern><template>Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 14 7</pattern><template>For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 14 8</pattern><template>Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 14 9</pattern><template>Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 14 10</pattern><template>But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 14 11</pattern><template>As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 14 12</pattern><template>So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 14 13</pattern><template>O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 14 14</pattern><template>If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 14 15</pattern><template>Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 14 16</pattern><template>For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 14 17</pattern><template>My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 14 18</pattern><template>And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 14 19</pattern><template>The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 14 20</pattern><template>Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 14 21</pattern><template>His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 14 22</pattern><template>But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 1</pattern><template>Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 2</pattern><template>Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 3</pattern><template>Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 4</pattern><template>Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 5</pattern><template>For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 6</pattern><template>Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 7</pattern><template>Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 8</pattern><template>Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 9</pattern><template>What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 10</pattern><template>With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 11</pattern><template>Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 12</pattern><template>Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 13</pattern><template>That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 14</pattern><template>What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 15</pattern><template>Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 16</pattern><template>How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 17</pattern><template>I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 18</pattern><template>Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 19</pattern><template>Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 20</pattern><template>The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 21</pattern><template>A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 22</pattern><template>He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 23</pattern><template>He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 24</pattern><template>Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 25</pattern><template>For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 26</pattern><template>He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 27</pattern><template>Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 28</pattern><template>And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 29</pattern><template>He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 30</pattern><template>He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 31</pattern><template>Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 32</pattern><template>It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 15 33</pattern><template>He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.</template></category>

<category><pattern>Job 16 3</pattern><template>Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 16 4</pattern><template>I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 16 5</pattern><template>But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 16 6</pattern><template>Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 16 7</pattern><template>But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 16 8</pattern><template>And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 16 9</pattern><template>He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 16 10</pattern><template>They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 16 11</pattern><template>God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 16 12</pattern><template>I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 16 13</pattern><template>His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 16 14</pattern><template>He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 16 15</pattern><template>I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 16 16</pattern><template>My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 16 17</pattern><template>Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 16 18</pattern><template>O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 16 19</pattern><template>Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 16 20</pattern><template>My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 16 21</pattern><template>O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 16 22</pattern><template>When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 17 1</pattern><template>My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 17 2</pattern><template>Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 17 3</pattern><template>Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 17 4</pattern><template>For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 17 5</pattern><template>He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 17 6</pattern><template>He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 17 7</pattern><template>Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 17 8</pattern><template>Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 17 9</pattern><template>The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 17 10</pattern><template>But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 17 11</pattern><template>My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 17 12</pattern><template>They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 17 13</pattern><template>If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 17 14</pattern><template>I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 17 15</pattern><template>And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 17 16</pattern><template>They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 18 1</pattern><template>Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 18 2</pattern><template>How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 18 3</pattern><template>Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 18 4</pattern><template>He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 18 5</pattern><template>Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 18 6</pattern><template>The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 18 7</pattern><template>The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 18 8</pattern><template>For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 18 9</pattern><template>The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 18 10</pattern><template>The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 18 11</pattern><template>Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 18 12</pattern><template>His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 18 13</pattern><template>It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 18 14</pattern><template>His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 18 15</pattern><template>It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 18 16</pattern><template>His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 18 17</pattern><template>His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 18 18</pattern><template>He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 18 19</pattern><template>He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 18 20</pattern><template>They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 18 21</pattern><template>Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 1</pattern><template>Then Job answered and said,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 2</pattern><template>How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 3</pattern><template>These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 4</pattern><template>And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 5</pattern><template>If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 6</pattern><template>Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 7</pattern><template>Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 8</pattern><template>He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 9</pattern><template>He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 10</pattern><template>He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 11</pattern><template>He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 12</pattern><template>His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 13</pattern><template>He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 14</pattern><template>My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 15</pattern><template>They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 16</pattern><template>I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 17</pattern><template>My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 18</pattern><template>Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 19</pattern><template>All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 20</pattern><template>My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 21</pattern><template>Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 22</pattern><template>Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 23</pattern><template>Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 24</pattern><template>That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 25</pattern><template>For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 26</pattern><template>And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 27</pattern><template>Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 28</pattern><template>But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 19 29</pattern><template>Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 1</pattern><template>Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 2</pattern><template>Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 3</pattern><template>I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 4</pattern><template>Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 5</pattern><template>That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 6</pattern><template>Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 7</pattern><template>Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 8</pattern><template>He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 9</pattern><template>The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 10</pattern><template>His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 11</pattern><template>His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 12</pattern><template>Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 13</pattern><template>Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 14</pattern><template>Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 15</pattern><template>He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 16</pattern><template>He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 17</pattern><template>He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 18</pattern><template>That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 19</pattern><template>Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 20</pattern><template>Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 21</pattern><template>There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 22</pattern><template>In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 23</pattern><template>When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 24</pattern><template>He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 25</pattern><template>It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 26</pattern><template>All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 27</pattern><template>The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 28</pattern><template>The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 20 29</pattern><template>This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 1</pattern><template>But Job answered and said,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 2</pattern><template>Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 3</pattern><template>Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 4</pattern><template>As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 5</pattern><template>Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 6</pattern><template>Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 7</pattern><template>Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 8</pattern><template>Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 9</pattern><template>Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 10</pattern><template>Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 11</pattern><template>They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 12</pattern><template>They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 13</pattern><template>They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 14</pattern><template>Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 15</pattern><template>What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 16</pattern><template>Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 17</pattern><template>How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 18</pattern><template>They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 19</pattern><template>God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 20</pattern><template>His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 21</pattern><template>For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 22</pattern><template>Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 23</pattern><template>One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 24</pattern><template>His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 25</pattern><template>And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 26</pattern><template>They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 27</pattern><template>Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 28</pattern><template>For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 29</pattern><template>Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 30</pattern><template>That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 31</pattern><template>Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 32</pattern><template>Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 33</pattern><template>The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 21 34</pattern><template>How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 1</pattern><template>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 2</pattern><template>Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 3</pattern><template>Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 4</pattern><template>Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 5</pattern><template>Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 6</pattern><template>For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 7</pattern><template>Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 8</pattern><template>But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 9</pattern><template>Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 10</pattern><template>Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 11</pattern><template>Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 12</pattern><template>Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 13</pattern><template>And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 14</pattern><template>Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 15</pattern><template>Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 16</pattern><template>Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 17</pattern><template>Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 18</pattern><template>Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 19</pattern><template>The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 20</pattern><template>Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 21</pattern><template>Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 22</pattern><template>Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 23</pattern><template>If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 24</pattern><template>Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 25</pattern><template>Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 26</pattern><template>For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 27</pattern><template>Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 28</pattern><template>Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 29</pattern><template>When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 22 30</pattern><template>He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 23 1</pattern><template>Then Job answered and said,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 23 2</pattern><template>Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 23 3</pattern><template>Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat!</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 23 4</pattern><template>I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 23 5</pattern><template>I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 23 6</pattern><template>Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 23 7</pattern><template>There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 23 8</pattern><template>Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 23 9</pattern><template>On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 23 10</pattern><template>But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.</template></category>

<category><pattern>Job 31 34</pattern><template>Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 31 35</pattern><template>Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 31 36</pattern><template>Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 31 37</pattern><template>I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 31 38</pattern><template>If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 31 39</pattern><template>If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 31 40</pattern><template>Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 32 1</pattern><template>So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 32 2</pattern><template>Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 32 3</pattern><template>Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 32 4</pattern><template>Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 32 5</pattern><template>When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 32 6</pattern><template>And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 32 7</pattern><template>I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 32 8</pattern><template>But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 32 9</pattern><template>Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 32 10</pattern><template>Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 32 11</pattern><template>Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 32 12</pattern><template>Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 32 13</pattern><template>Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 32 14</pattern><template>Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 32 15</pattern><template>They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 32 16</pattern><template>When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 32 17</pattern><template>I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 32 18</pattern><template>For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 32 19</pattern><template>Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 32 20</pattern><template>I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 32 21</pattern><template>Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 32 22</pattern><template>For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 1</pattern><template>Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 2</pattern><template>Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 3</pattern><template>My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 4</pattern><template>The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 5</pattern><template>If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 6</pattern><template>Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 7</pattern><template>Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 8</pattern><template>Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 9</pattern><template>I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 10</pattern><template>Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 11</pattern><template>He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 12</pattern><template>Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 13</pattern><template>Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 14</pattern><template>For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 15</pattern><template>In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 16</pattern><template>Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 17</pattern><template>That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 18</pattern><template>He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 19</pattern><template>He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 20</pattern><template>So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 21</pattern><template>His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 22</pattern><template>Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 23</pattern><template>If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 24</pattern><template>Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 25</pattern><template>His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 26</pattern><template>He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 27</pattern><template>He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 28</pattern><template>He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 29</pattern><template>Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 30</pattern><template>To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 31</pattern><template>Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 32</pattern><template>If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 33 33</pattern><template>If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 1</pattern><template>Furthermore Elihu answered and said,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 2</pattern><template>Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 3</pattern><template>For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 4</pattern><template>Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 5</pattern><template>For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 6</pattern><template>Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 7</pattern><template>What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 8</pattern><template>Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 9</pattern><template>For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 10</pattern><template>Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 11</pattern><template>For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 12</pattern><template>Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 13</pattern><template>Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 14</pattern><template>If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 15</pattern><template>All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 16</pattern><template>If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 17</pattern><template>Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 18</pattern><template>Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 19</pattern><template>How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 20</pattern><template>In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 21</pattern><template>For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 22</pattern><template>There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 23</pattern><template>For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 24</pattern><template>He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 25</pattern><template>Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 26</pattern><template>He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 27</pattern><template>Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 28</pattern><template>So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 29</pattern><template>When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 30</pattern><template>That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 31</pattern><template>Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 32</pattern><template>That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 33</pattern><template>Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 34</pattern><template>Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 35</pattern><template>Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 36</pattern><template>My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 34 37</pattern><template>For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 35 1</pattern><template>Elihu spake moreover, and said,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 35 2</pattern><template>Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 35 3</pattern><template>For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 35 4</pattern><template>I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 35 5</pattern><template>Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 35 6</pattern><template>If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 35 7</pattern><template>If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 35 8</pattern><template>Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 35 9</pattern><template>By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 35 10</pattern><template>But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 35 11</pattern><template>Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 35 12</pattern><template>There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 35 13</pattern><template>Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 35 14</pattern><template>Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 35 15</pattern><template>But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 35 16</pattern><template>Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 1</pattern><template>Elihu also proceeded, and said,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 2</pattern><template>Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 3</pattern><template>I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 4</pattern><template>For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 5</pattern><template>Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 6</pattern><template>He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 7</pattern><template>He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 8</pattern><template>And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 9</pattern><template>Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 10</pattern><template>He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 11</pattern><template>If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 12</pattern><template>But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 13</pattern><template>But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 14</pattern><template>They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 15</pattern><template>He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 16</pattern><template>Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 17</pattern><template>But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 18</pattern><template>Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 19</pattern><template>Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 20</pattern><template>Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 21</pattern><template>Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 22</pattern><template>Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 23</pattern><template>Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 24</pattern><template>Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 25</pattern><template>Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 26</pattern><template>Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 27</pattern><template>For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 28</pattern><template>Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 29</pattern><template>Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 30</pattern><template>Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 31</pattern><template>For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 32</pattern><template>With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 36 33</pattern><template>The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 37 1</pattern><template>At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 37 2</pattern><template>Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 37 3</pattern><template>He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 37 4</pattern><template>After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 37 5</pattern><template>God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 37 6</pattern><template>For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 37 7</pattern><template>He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 37 8</pattern><template>Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 37 9</pattern><template>Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 37 10</pattern><template>By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 37 11</pattern><template>Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 37 12</pattern><template>And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 37 13</pattern><template>He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 37 14</pattern><template>Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 37 15</pattern><template>Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 37 16</pattern><template>Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 37 17</pattern><template>How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 37 18</pattern><template>Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 37 19</pattern><template>Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 37 20</pattern><template>Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 37 21</pattern><template>And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 37 22</pattern><template>Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 37 23</pattern><template>Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 37 24</pattern><template>Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 38 1</pattern><template>Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 38 2</pattern><template>Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 38 3</pattern><template>Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 38 4</pattern><template>Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 38 5</pattern><template>Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 38 6</pattern><template>Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 38 7</pattern><template>When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 38 8</pattern><template>Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 38 9</pattern><template>When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 38 10</pattern><template>And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 38 11</pattern><template>And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 38 12</pattern><template>Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 38 13</pattern><template>That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 38 14</pattern><template>It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 38 15</pattern><template>And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Job 38 16</pattern><template>Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?</template></category>
