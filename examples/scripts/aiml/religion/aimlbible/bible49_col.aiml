<category><pattern>Colossians 1 4</pattern><template>Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 1 5</pattern><template>For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 1 6</pattern><template>Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:</template></category>

<category><pattern>Colossians 1 15</pattern><template>Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 1 16</pattern><template>For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 1 17</pattern><template>And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.</template></category>

<category><pattern>Colossians 1 23</pattern><template>If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 1 24</pattern><template>Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 1 25</pattern><template>Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 1 26</pattern><template>Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:</template></category>

<category><pattern>Colossians 2 4</pattern><template>And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 2 5</pattern><template>For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 2 6</pattern><template>As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 2 7</pattern><template>Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 2 8</pattern><template>Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 2 9</pattern><template>For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 2 10</pattern><template>And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 2 11</pattern><template>In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 2 12</pattern><template>Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 2 13</pattern><template>And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 2 14</pattern><template>Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 2 15</pattern><template>And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 2 16</pattern><template>Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 2 17</pattern><template>Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 2 18</pattern><template>Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 2 19</pattern><template>And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 2 20</pattern><template>Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 2 21</pattern><template>(Touch not; taste not; handle not;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 2 22</pattern><template>Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 2 23</pattern><template>Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 3 1</pattern><template>If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 3 2</pattern><template>Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 3 3</pattern><template>For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 3 4</pattern><template>When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 3 5</pattern><template>Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 3 6</pattern><template>For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 3 7</pattern><template>In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 3 8</pattern><template>But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 3 9</pattern><template>Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 3 10</pattern><template>And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 3 11</pattern><template>Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 3 12</pattern><template>Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 3 13</pattern><template>Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 3 14</pattern><template>And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 3 15</pattern><template>And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 3 16</pattern><template>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 3 17</pattern><template>And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 3 18</pattern><template>Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 3 19</pattern><template>Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 3 20</pattern><template>Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 3 21</pattern><template>Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 3 22</pattern><template>Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 3 23</pattern><template>And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 3 24</pattern><template>Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 3 25</pattern><template>But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 4 1</pattern><template>Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 4 2</pattern><template>Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 4 3</pattern><template>Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 4 4</pattern><template>That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Colossians 4 5</pattern><template>Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.</template></category>
