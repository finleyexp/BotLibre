<category><pattern>Nahum 1 11</pattern><template>There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the LORD, a wicked counsellor.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nahum 1 12</pattern><template>Thus saith the LORD; Though they be quiet, and likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nahum 1 13</pattern><template>For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nahum 1 14</pattern><template>And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.</template></category>

<category><pattern>Nahum 2 13</pattern><template>Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.</template></category>
